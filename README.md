# Shine Project

## The Project

The SLA, well known by the name charcot disease, is amongs all rare sickness the more common one...
Just in France charcot disease is responsible of :
- 3 new diagnostics per day
- 6 000 persons are living with this unhealing disease
- 1 200 death per year

We've created a website that gathers patients, their friends, family and companions. Also associations that can help, write articles and gather people around events to fight all together around illness. 

## How does it work

This app is run on rails 5.2.4 and ruby 2.5.1
Check the Gemfile for more. 

#### For locals only : 
Clone the repository : 
```
git clone https://github.com/hermine-dm/helpnet/
```
Install gems and versions : 
```
bundle install
```
Create the PostgreSQL Database : 
```
rails db:create
```
Time for some nice migrations : 
```
rails db:migrate
```
Fullfill the database (this will send a lot of emails - you can comment them in user model and article model) : 
```
rails db:seed
```
Now you can run your server for locals only : 
```
rails s
```
Enjoy and peace out man ! 

#### In production
Yes, you're right it's a hard work to make it work on your local machine, that why it's for locals only. We have a solution for you...guess what it's also available online using Heroku.
Go on https://helpnet-prod.herokuapp.com

This app has :
- a user Model
- an organization Model
- an article Model
- an events Model
- an all the models that are needed for the relations between join table, admin... (11 in total - what a big number mate).

The forum and all private messages are generated by the thredded gem.
